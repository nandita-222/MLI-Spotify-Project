## 💡 Key Technical Concepts

### TF-IDF (Text Encoding)
- Captures importance of words in artist/song/album names
- Helps identify artist/genre preferences
- Creates 110 text-based features

### Feature Interactions
- Captures relationships between features
- E.g., energy×loudness captures intensity
- Reveals hidden patterns

### One-Class SVM
- Learns boundary of user's taste
- Identifies songs within user's preference region
- Scores candidates based on distance to boundary

### Temporal Features
- Song age relative to current year
- Release timing patterns
- Years since song was in top playlist
