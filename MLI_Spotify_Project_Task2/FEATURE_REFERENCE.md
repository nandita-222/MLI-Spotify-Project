## 📈 Feature Selection Strategy

### For Recommendation Model
The following features are used in the final model:

```python
audio_features = [
    'acousticness', 'danceability', 'energy', 'instrumentalness',
    'liveness', 'loudness', 'speechiness', 'tempo', 'valence'
]

temporal_features = ['song_age', 'years_since_top', 'release_month']

interaction_features = [
    'energy_loudness', 'danceability_tempo', 'valence_energy',
    'acoustic_instrumental', 'speech_to_music_ratio'
]

categorical_binary = [
    'mode_major', 'is_popular', 'is_high_energy',
    'is_happy', 'is_short_song', 'is_long_song'
]

text_features = [all TF-IDF features from artist, song, album]
```

**Total Model Features**: 110+
